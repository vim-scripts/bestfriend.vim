==========

Who is the your best friend?
If you want to know, this is an answer.

This plugin is not so practical, but might provide a bit interest:)

How to install
----------
If you use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git) it's very easy, you just run command `:BundleInstall tacahiroy/vim-bestfriend`
inside vim.  
And also put `Bundle 'tacahiroy/vim-bestfriend'` into `.vimrc`.

If you use [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), you just execute following:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tacahiroy/vim-bestfriend.git

If you use neither Vundle nor pathogen, copy autoload and plugin directory  
into your `$HOME/.vim` directory.
\* on Windows, you probably copy those files into `_vim` directory.

Usage
----------
bestfriend.vim provide 2 commands to show your best friend.

* `:BestFriend` shows edit time of the current file.
* `:BestFriends` shows ranking of edit time.

Actually bestfriend.vim provides several options.
